# TelMusic
A simple music player, modernly designed

This project was started by me as a pass time, but has evolved into something noteworthy. It is really just a simply music
player but with a modern design and simple feel. Every action you make (except a small settings menu of course) is 
conducted within the initial, global screen. No switching panels, or new pages, everything is served to you then and there,
but still in as organized of a fasion as possible.
