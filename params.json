It is really just a simply music\r\nplayer but with a modern design and simple feel. Every action you make (except a small settings menu of course) is \r\nconducted within the initial, global screen. No switching panels, or new pages, everything is served to you then and there,\r\nbut still in as organized of a fasion as possible.\r\n\r\n<h1>TelMusic v.1.0 in its native Windows 10 glory (Demonstrating how to add a group of songs to a playlist)</h1>\r\n<img src=\"http://puu.sh/jyXne/d5529e9f34.jpg\" alt=\"Error loading image\">\r\n\r\n<h1>Changelog</h1>\r\n    Version 1.1\r\n        Fixed:\r\n            Fixed error with loading a playlist that contained a song that has a special character in it\r\n\r\n\r\n    Version 1.0\r\n    Additions:\r\n        Added Ability to save new playlist\r\n        Added Ability to save selected songs to existing playlist\r\n    \r\n    Fixes: \r\n        Fixed some compatibility problems with how ID3 tagged songs were loaded\r\n        Shares many fixes with 0.8 release\r\n        \r\n    Changes:\r\n        Cleaned up A LOT of code\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nd/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a>\r\n<br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/InteractiveResource\" property=\"dct:title\" rel=\"dct:type\">TelMusic</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"telpathstudios.blogspot.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Jacob DeJean</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
